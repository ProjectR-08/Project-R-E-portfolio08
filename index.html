							</header>
	

							<p style="text-align: left; color: black;"> It is an electronic porfolio (e-portfolio) is a purposeful collection of sample student work, demonstrations, and artifacts that showcase student's learning progression, achievement, and evidence of what students can do. The collection can include essays and papers (text-based), blog, multimedia (recordings of demonstrations, interviews, presentations, etc.), graphic 	
								<a href="https://teaching.berkeley.edu/resources/assessment-and-evaluation/design-assessment/e-portfolio">
									(Berkeley 2021).
								</a>
							
							<br/><br/>
							
							It can help learners to develop their skills and talent. That can be shared to friends, families, and showcase learner's in achievement when they are applying for a job - in short, it can be a simple or more advanced folder where all of your achievements, informations, about yourself, etc are included.
							
							<br/><br/>
							
							On the other hand, e-portfolio is a software based application or web based designed to replicate a learner's portfolio into a form of online processing. In which it allows public (without exception) to remotely accessed into it but in a secure server also, it is to prevent the copyright and stealing your private info that can be used by hackers or any malicious people around you to exposed you to through bad self.
							
							<br/><br/>
							
							Some of the advantages of e-portfolio includes;
							
							<br/>
							
								<ol style="text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
									<li>
										A reduction in costs of assessment and quality assurance
									</li>
									<li>
										The ability for learners to upload information whenever they are at a computer
									</li>
									<li>
										The facility for internal and external quality assurance
									</li>
									<li>
										The facility for the learners' Line Manager to check progress
									</li>
									<li>
										The ability to store electronic evidence such as video, sound files or photographs
									</li>
									<li>
										The reduced impact of ‘lost portfolios’
									</li>
									<li>
										The safe storage of current and archived portfolios.

										</p>
										<p style="text-align: left;">
											The House at Night presents an empty street lined with buildings, whose sharp angles and diagonals and
glowing colors imbue what otherwise might be a quiet scene with intensity and energy. From this source, I decided
to chose this Expressionism art work where in times of pandemic – all people whom are actively walking down
the street. While the night represents REST where all are quietly sleeping. How it connects to my own self? Well,
according to the source, the geometrical form is similar to disoriented set design for The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari
(a popular expressionist film) that evoke the anxiety of a town plagued by a sleepwalking murderer. It connected
not just for me but for all of us, it connects while we are resting we cannot stop someone else to destruct us by
killing words and action to makes us unstable.

										<p style="text-align: left;">
											In French, Woman with Black Glove is Femme au gant noir or Femme Assise. It is a painting by French
artist, theorist, and writer Albert Gleizes. It consists of experimental style that transpired during the second
synthetic phase of Cubism, called Crystal Cubism. I chose this artwork because of its dialogue emerging between
the limits of the medium of painting and the fullness of space.

							<p style="text-align: left;">The author and developer of this e-portfolio is a student of Aurora State College of Technology. <br/><br/>In order to protect his privacy, he intended to lessen the info to present in this e-portfolio. <br/><br/>His name is Rhomar "Nickname: Max." He is a third year (3) IT student, and he is an official member of the The Voice of the Sierra (an official publisher of ASCOT) for three years as a photojourn. He love doing photography, videography, editing video (AE and Cinematic), editing picture (photoshop) and designing (photo), and of course he loves doing some different staffs that was not far from his interest.<br/><br/>He graduated Elementary and High School in Dipaculao, Aurora, and graduated SHS in LEA while he became an official member of Advocates as a photojourn and layout-artist in his 12 grade (that's when he had an interest in journalism).<br/><br/>He is not interested in socializing to too many people around and the only reason is mysterious. But if it is all about doing acivities (school staff's or out of school that includes getting an experience) including photography, editting, and videography - he is interested and smart.<br/><br/>His dream and goal was to become a professional photographer, a web developer (front-end or full stack), a videographer, and a photo-designer.<br/><br/>He is motivated and inspired to the quotes:</p><p><b style="font-size: 100px; font-family: 'Cambria'">"</b>Going to school without learning is nonsense.<br/> Going to school without getting your skills are nonsense.<br/> Living with an unprofitable life, lifestyle in nonsense. "<br/><p><b style="font-size: 100px; font-family: 'Cambria'">"</b>Living is worst and cruel without getting your dreams than <br/>Dying without getting your dreams. <br/>So, it is good to be dead at for once than ... living without it.<br/><p><b style="font-size: 100px; font-family: 'Cambria'">"</b>Friends are useless unless...<br/> if they support you to get your dreams come true <br/>and can listen to what you feels, also."</p>

								How did I make this Reponsive E-Portfolio?
							</h5>
							<p style="text-align: left;">
								<br/>
								At first, maybe some of you don't know how I made this e-portfolio.
								<br/><br/>
								In here, I am gonna share my experience in doing its.
								<br/><br/>
								First, I looked some free open source responsive template repository in google.
								<br/><br/>
								Second, after I found what tempate I'd liked to used - I downloaded it.
								<br/><br/>
								Third, after I've downloaded the template. I modified it - but of course with the help of my knowledge in HTML and CSS.
								<br/><br/>
								Fourth, I created a repository in my <a href="github.com">Github</a> account. But for reason, I already have an account, so, in my case - I only added some commitment into my repository. At first, while I am committing into my repository, I experienced some problems. My website source was exceeded to 1GB plus, but the github storage was limited to 25MB. But for reason, I figured it out to prevent this. I decided that all of my videos that was embedded to my website was to be uploaded to my youtube account. So that, storage that github wanted will be accepted.
								<br/><br/>
								Fifth. I <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line">pulled and pushed</a> my modified website to my repository in github that I have created. 
								<br/><br/>
								Sixth, afted I pushed and pulled it in my reposity, I also modified my link to make it liked a unique website.
								<br/><br/>
								Bwalaaaaa! Now you have your source code uploaded to the google. With this, everyone can search your site.
								<br/><br/>
								The only reason why I made it on a hard way than using an auto-webstite-builder like wix, wordpress, or any free websites that supports in creating website is that, I wanted to understand how the responsives work and make, and of course I am looking for an experience to support my future website. Coz, maybe later - maybe next year - I will build some website where every students can used to it and even teachers or instructor around the internet, but that is for next season.
